Instructions:

First you need to upload the files on a hosting server in order to run it, since HTML5 localstorage does not work when your running local pages using your browser.

After you have uploaded the files simply enter the url pointing to the setup.html file.

It should look like this: http://alphazemerge.com/dev/setup.html

Note: I took out the image files since they were bought on istockphoto and cannot be redistributed.

****************************************************

Files that comprise the simulation:

setup.html - Setup input variables for simulation, initializes all the local storage data.

run.html - Frontend html displaying simulation results and acccepts user input. (VIEW/CONTROLLER)

simulation.js - Javascript accompanying run.html to render the frontend. (VIEW/CONTROLLER)

engine.js - Logic of the simulation, local storage data is altered and computed here. (MODEL)

az.css - Style sheets for the simulation. (VIEW)
